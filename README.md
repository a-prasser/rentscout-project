# Vision Statement

Many Calvin sophomores are rapidly approaching the stressful time when they must declare where they will live the following year when the standard dorms are no longer the default option. Many students settle on the first rental they can find because it can be very difficult to both find and know how to approach comparing more than one in order to find the best fit for them and their housemates. This means landlords compete to be the easiest properties to find instead of to create the best value property. In response to this problem, we present RentScout.

RentScout is an app targeted at Calvin University students and is intended to clearly display local rental properties. This app will support a more beneficial direct competition between landlords by allowing renters to filter properties by metrics such as distance from campus, price point, location rating, and landlord rating. While some of these metrics are objective and easily compilable, we are most excited about the landlord and property rating systems. These will provide incentives for landlords to treat current tenants well and allow future renters to be better informed about the rental situation that they might contract into, similar to how the renter referral system incentivizes renters to treat properties well and protects property owners from excess hassle and harm.

While there are a lot of competitor apps on the market, most of them are focused on either longer-term rentals or on apartments. From what we can tell, no app is focused on the college student market directly. This will provide market access and a specific target audience in a way that no competitor is currently addressing, and it will aid students with a more simplified and student-specific rental search process.
