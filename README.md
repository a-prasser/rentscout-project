# 🏡 RentScout – Calvin Students’ Guide to Off-Campus Housing

RentScout is a mobile-first property listing app built specifically for **Calvin University students**. Developed as part of our university software engineering course, it aims to simplify and improve the student rental experience by offering better information, transparency, and usability than existing generic rental platforms.

## 📌 Project Overview

Navigating the off-campus housing market can be stressful for students and confusing for landlords. Traditional platforms like Zillow or Trulia cater to long-term renters and can overwhelm first-time renters with excessive features and listings not relevant to college students.

**RentScout fills this niche by:**
- Filtering listings based on distance from campus, rent price, and ratings.
- Enabling verified **student reviews** of properties and landlords.
- Helping landlords better reach their target audience while improving accountability.

This system encourages a more transparent, community-driven rental experience that supports both students and landlords.
